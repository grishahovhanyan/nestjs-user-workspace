Throughout the project, you will encounter `NOTE` comments that provide important context or instructions. These comments are intended to guide developers in understanding key parts of the code, configuration, and best practices.

## üíª Prerequisites:

Ensure you have the following tools installed in your PC:

- NodeJS (along with npm)
- NestJS
- MySql

## üöÄ Run project:

1. Clone the repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/grishahovhanyan/nestjs-user-workspace.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```sh
cd nestjs-user-workspace
```

3. Run the following command to install all dependencies:

```sh
npm install
```

4. Create a .env file from the provided .env.example file.

```sh
cp .env.example .env
```

5. To run migrations, use the following command:

```sh
npm run migrations:run
```

6. To run the development environment, use the following command:

```sh
npm run start:dev
```

After starting the server, you can access the application at: http://localhost:PORT_FROM_ENV/swagger-ui/

## üê≥ Run project with docker compose:

1. After clone go to the project directory and create a .env file from the provided .env.example file.

```sh
cp .env.example .env
```

2. Build Docker images for a multi-container application defined in a Docker Compose file.

```sh
docker compose up --build
```

3. Run Docker containers based on the images created in the previous step.

```sh
docker compose up
```

## üê≥ Run project with docker:

1. After clone go to the project directory and create a .env file from the provided .env.example file.

```sh
cp .env.example .env
```

2. Build a Docker image for project using the Dockerfile located in the "docker" directory.

```sh
docker build . -f docker/Dockerfile
```

3. Run a Docker container using the image created in the previous step.

```sh
docker run --entrypoint /usr/src/app/docker/entrypoint.sh -it IMAGE_ID_FROM_PREVIOUS_STEP /usr/src/app/docker/start_node.sh
```

## üóÇÔ∏è NPM Commands

- **`npm run format`**: Formats TypeScript files in the `src`, `test`, and `libs` directories according to the rules defined in the `.prettierrc.js` configuration file.

- **`npm run lint`**: Executes ESLint to check for code quality issues and ensure that the code adheres to the defined coding standards.

- **`npm run build`**: Compiles TypeScript files into JavaScript and outputs the results into the `dist` folder, preparing the application for deployment.

- **`npm run start`**: Starts the NestJS application in production mode using the compiled files from the `dist` folder.

- **`npm run start:dev`**: Launches the application in development mode with live reloading enabled, automatically restarting the server when changes are detected.

- **`npm run start:debug`**: Runs the application in debug mode with live reloading, allowing for debugging and step-by-step code execution.

- **`npm run start:prod`**: Starts the compiled production-ready application using Node.js, running the code from the `dist/main` file.

- **`npm run typeorm`**: Runs TypeORM CLI commands using `ts-node` to handle database-related tasks, such as running migrations, without needing to compile TypeScript code first.

- **`npm run migrations:create`**: Creates a new migration file in the specified `migrations` directory, which can be used to define database schema changes.

- **`npm run migrations:generate`**: Automatically generates a migration file based on the current state of the entities, capturing any schema changes that need to be applied to the database.

- **`npm run migrations:run`**: Applies all pending migrations to the database, updating the schema according to the latest migration files.

- **`npm run migrations:rollback`**: Reverts the last migration that was applied, rolling back the database schema to the previous state.
